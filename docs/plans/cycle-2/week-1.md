# Workout Plan

## General Instructions

1.  **Progressive Overload is Your Goal:** Your primary mission is to get stronger. Each week, try to add a little more weight to your lifts or do one more rep than last time with the same weight. Track your workouts in a notebook or on your phone.
2.  **Form First, Always:** With new exercises like the Barbell Squat and Overhead Press, your priority is perfect form. It's better to use a lighter weight with perfect form than a heavy weight with poor form, which can lead to injury.
3.  **Mind-Muscle Connection:** On your hypertrophy days (Day 4 & 5), really focus on feeling the target muscle work. Don't just move the weight; squeeze the muscle at the peak of the contraction.
4. While this workout plan will build muscle and burn calories, reducing belly fat primarily comes down to your diet and incorporating cardiovascular exercise.

-   **Diet:** Creating a sustainable calorie deficit is key. Focus on whole, unprocessed foods, lean protein, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates. Limit sugary drinks, processed snacks, and excessive unhealthy fats.
-   **Cardio:** Incorporate 20-30 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio 3-4 times a week on your rest days or after your strength training sessions. This could be:
    *   Brisk walking
    *   Jogging
    *   Cycling
    *   Swimming
    *   Elliptical
    *   HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training): As you progress, you might consider 15-20 minutes of HIIT a couple of times a week. This involves short bursts of intense exercise followed by brief recovery periods (e.g., 30 seconds sprint, 60 seconds walk). HIIT can be very effective for fat loss, but it's more demanding, so ease into it.

## Day 1: Upper Body (Strength Focus)

This day is centered around building strength in your main upper body "push" and "pull" movements.

-   **Barbell Overhead Press (OHP):** 4 x 6-8 reps
    *   *Why:* This is a progression from the dumbbell press. Using a barbell allows you to lift heavier, building more raw strength and power in the shoulders. It also requires significant core stability.

-   **Bent-Over Barbell Rows:** 4 x 6-8 reps
    *   *Why:* This is one of the best exercises for building a thick, strong back. It's a great progression from single-arm dumbbell rows, allowing for a heavier load. Focus on squeezing your shoulder blades together.

-   **Flat Dumbbell Press:** 3 x 8-10 reps
    *   *Why:* Targets the mid-chest. Using dumbbells allows for a greater range of motion and helps build stabilizer muscles compared to a barbell.
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VmB1G1K7v94?si=YdTVhkbQVCl1t4_j" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

-   **Lat Pulldowns (or Pull-ups):** 3 x 8-12 reps
    *   *Why:* This targets your lats (the muscles that give you a 'V' taper) from a vertical angle, complementing your horizontal row. If you can do pull-ups, do 3 sets to failure. If not, the lat pulldown machine is the perfect alternative.

-   **Barbell Bicep Curls:** 3 x 8-12 reps
    *   *Why:* We keep this fundamental mass builder for the biceps. Focus on increasing the weight from your previous weeks.
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LY1V6UbRHFM?si=nOp4HK1AqO9UllOC" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

-   **Triceps Pushdowns (Cable):** 3 x 8-12 reps
    *   *Why:* Excellent for triceps isolation. Again, focus on progressively adding weight while maintaining strict form.

## Day 2: Lower Body (Strength Focus)

This day is built around the most important lower body strength exercise: the squat.

-   **Barbell Back Squats:** 4 x 6-8 reps
    *   *Why:* This is the natural progression from Goblet Squats. It is the king of leg exercises for building overall leg size, strength, and core stability. *Please prioritize form:* watch videos, start with just the bar, and only add weight when you are comfortable and confident.

-   **Romanian Deadlifts (Barbell):** 3 x 8-10 reps
    *   *Why:* Continue with this fantastic hamstring and glute developer. Using a barbell will allow you to handle more weight as you get stronger.
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JCXUYuzwNrM?si=i40KUJtaAciBzdJZ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

-   **Walking Lunges (Dumbbell):** 3 x 10-12 reps per leg
    *   *Why:* Remains a top-tier exercise for hitting every muscle in the legs and improving balance. Focus on increasing the dumbbell weight.
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D7KaRcUTQeE?si=786L-yRk2LtcxBWK" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

-   **Leg Press:** 3 x 10-12 reps
    *   *Why:* Allows you to add more volume to your quads and glutes without taxing your lower back and core, which will be tired from the squats and RDLs.
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oujca3_Shgw?si=bAuP35fniYft-0bS" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

-   **Standing Calf Raises:** 4 x 10-15 reps
    *   *Why:* The standing variation puts more emphasis on the larger gastrocnemius muscle of the calf.
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3UWi44yN-wM?si=EJvJAsOJaLOqoUCe" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Day 3: Rest / Active Recovery

Light cardio, stretching, foam rolling, hydration, and nutrition. Your muscles grow when they rest, so don't skip this.

## Day 4: Upper Body (Hypertrophy Focus)

This day uses higher reps and more isolation to focus on muscle growth (hypertrophy) and shape.

-   **Incline Dumbbell Press:** 3 x 10-15 reps
    *   *Why:* Emphasizes the upper chest and front delts. The higher rep range will create a great "pump."
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8iPEnn-ltC8?si=F0riHgMjBprcRlte" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

-   **Single-Arm Dumbbell Rows:** 3 x 10-12 reps per arm
    *   *Why:* Excellent for focusing on the mind-muscle connection with your lats. The unilateral movement helps ensure symmetrical development.
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KRN38chlkds?si=juU29vrSERCGr7p8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

-   **Lateral Raises (Dumbbell):** 4 x 12-15 reps
    *   *Why:* We increase the volume on this exercise because it is the single best movement for creating shoulder width. Keep the weight light and the form strict.
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3VcKaXpzqRo?si=EyJOL3q9JpgRzbgc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

-   **Face Pulls (Cable):** 3 x 15-20 reps
    *   *Why:* Remains crucial for rear delt development and shoulder health. This balances all the pressing you're doing.

-   **Superset: Dumbbell Hammer Curls & Overhead Triceps Extensions**
    *   **Dumbbell Hammer Curls:** 3 x 12-15 reps
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zC3nLlEvin4?si=_MJJwggMKSNMilng" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    *   **Overhead Triceps Extensions (Dumbbell):** 3 x 12-15 reps
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YbX7Wd8jQ-Q?si=ZZ0Uti6mU5-Atvfm" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    *   *Why:* A superset (performing two exercises back-to-back with no rest) increases intensity and saves time. This combination targets arm thickness (brachialis) and the long head of the triceps, which adds significant size to the arm.

## Day 5: Lower Body & Core (Hypertrophy Focus)

Focus on isolation, mind-muscle connection, and higher volume for your legs and core.

-   **Bulgarian Split Squats:** 3 x 10-12 reps per leg
    *   *Why:* A challenging progression from lunges. This exercise hammers your quads and glutes while improving stability. You can do these with just your body weight or by holding dumbbells.
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2C-uNgKwPLE?si=yqTEqba2ay4TlZDj" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

-   **Leg Curls (Machine):** 3 x 12-15 reps
    *   *Why:* Directly isolates the hamstrings. Focus on a slow, controlled negative (the lowering phase).
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ELOCsoDSmrg?si=RRHHD75npfDy3UvF" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

-   **Leg Extensions (Machine):** 3 x 12-15 reps
    *   *Why:* Directly isolates the quadriceps, helping to bring out detail.
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YyvSfVjQeL0?si=iea3JAddgDC32Rj_" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

-   **Hip Thrusts (Barbell or Dumbbell):** 3 x 12-15 reps
    *   *Why:* The best exercise for direct glute development. As you get stronger, progress from a dumbbell on your lap to a barbell.
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SEdqd1n0cvg?si=o99z3iwSKnxfd17a" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

-   **Core Circuit (Perform back-to-back, rest 60s, repeat 3 times):**
    *   **Hanging Knee Raises:** 15-20 reps (Progression from lying leg raises)
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X-ACS9vpRyU?si=VqqXqorJ8oGjnZcs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    *   **Cable Wood Chops:** 10-15 reps per side (Excellent for oblique and rotational strength)
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pAplQXk3dkU?si=Ni3ZCa5pW-r3dRro" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    *   **Plank:** Hold for 45-75 seconds
