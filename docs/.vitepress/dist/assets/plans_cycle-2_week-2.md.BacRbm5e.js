Each week, try to add a little more weight to your lifts or do one more rep than last time with the same weight. Track your workouts in a notebook or on your phone.</li><li><strong>Form First, Always:</strong> With new exercises like the Barbell Squat and Overhead Press, your priority is perfect form. It’s better to use a lighter weight with perfect form than a heavy weight with poor form, which can lead to injury.</li><li><strong>Mind-Muscle Connection:</strong> On your hypertrophy days (Day 4 &amp; 5), really focus on feeling the target muscle work. Don’t just move the weight; squeeze the muscle at the peak of the contraction.</li><li>While this workout plan will build muscle and burn calories, reducing belly fat primarily comes down to your diet and incorporating cardiovascular exercise.</li></ol><ul><li><strong>Diet:</strong> Creating a sustainable calorie deficit is key. Focus on whole, unprocessed foods, lean protein, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates. Limit sugary drinks, processed snacks, and excessive unhealthy fats.</li><li><strong>Cardio:</strong> Incorporate 20-30 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio 3-4 times a week on your rest days or after your strength training sessions. This could be: <ul><li>Brisk walking</li><li>Jogging</li><li>Cycling</li><li>Swimming</li><li>Elliptical</li><li>HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training): As you progress, you might consider 15-20 minutes of HIIT a couple of times a week. This involves short bursts of intense exercise followed by brief recovery periods (e.g., 30 seconds sprint, 60 seconds walk). HIIT can be very effective for fat loss, but it’s more demanding, so ease into it.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="day-1-upper-body-strength-focus" tabindex="-1">Day 1: Upper Body (Strength Focus) <a class="header-anchor" href="#day-1-upper-body-strength-focus" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Day 1: Upper Body (Strength Focus)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This day is centered around building strength in your main upper body “push” and “pull” movements.</p>',6),e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[e("strong",null,"Barbell Overhead Press (OHP):"),l(" 4 x 6-8 reps "),e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[e("em",null,"Why:"),l(" This is a progression from the dumbbell press.
